I am testing out my skills using a functional fitness tracker of my own real gym progress which i will try to manipulate also through my phone in some near future.

For now, i am creating a main code, which will allow me to access all the different functionalities of my fitness tracker. It will include a data visualization of some sort and a separate code managing the csv files.
